    "If you are able to see this successfully, it means you have downloaded this notebook file (<code>**Homework_01.ipynb**</code>) on your local machine, started up your Jupyter Notebook server, and opened the notebook file from the running server.<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, you will be prompted with a sequence of coding exercises.\n",
    "Each (code) cell contains a single exercise; <u>unless otherwise specified</u>, each exercise is **self-contained**, i.e., there is no dependency with any other exercise contained in the above cells. In other words, you don't need to solve exercises in any particular order and/or execute the notebook's cells in the same order as they appear.<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Please, remember that to execute a cell you need to do the following:\n",
    "-  Be sure the cell is selected (you can verify this by looking at the cell border: if this is green the cell is selected);\n",
    "-  Go to the *Main Menu* bar, click on *Cell --> Run Cells*. Alternatively, you can use a keyboard shortcut (e.g., <code>**Ctrl + Enter**</code>).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I **strongly** recommend you not to delete nor modify this notebook in any of its parts. As this is not a read-only file, anyone could make changes to it. Should you do it by mistake, just download this notebook file again from our [Moodle web page](https://elearning.unipd.it/math/course/view.php?id=321)."
