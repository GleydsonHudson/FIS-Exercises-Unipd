    "In the following, you will be prompted with a sequence of coding exercises.\n",
    "Each (code) cell contains a single exercise; <u>unless otherwise specified</u>, each exercise is **self-contained**, i.e., there is no dependency with any other exercise contained in the above cells. In other words, you don't need to solve exercises in any particular order and/or execute the notebook's cells in the same order as they appear.<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Each exercise is labeled as **Exercise N**, where **N = {1, 2, ...}**. The cell right below the exercise label contains a (natural language) description of what you are expected to do to solve the exercise, along with one or two examples of expected outputs. Possibly, you may be prompted with some suggestions or requirements, which help you answer correctly.<br />\n",
    "Below each code question, there is one (or more) code solution cells which you are asked to fill. More specifically, if **Exercise N** contains just one question then you will see a code cell labeled as **Solution N**. Instead, if the exercise contains more than one question, you will see something like **Solution N.x**, where **x = {1, 2, ...}** (i.e., as many code solution cells as the number of questions).<br /> \n",
    "A typical code solution cell contains the skeleton of a function; the function has a signature (name and input arguments) which has already been defined (**PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE IT!**). You are asked to implement the function according to the decription provided above. To do so, you must replace the <code>**# YOUR CODE HERE**</code> with your own code. <br />\n",
    "Once you have done it and you are confident that your solution works as you expect, just run the corresponding test code cell (labeled as **Test N** or **Test N.x** depending on the number of questions within the same **Exercise N**) right below the specific solution code cell.\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Please, remember that to execute a cell you need to do the following:\n",
    "-  Be sure the cell is selected (you can verify this by looking at the cell border: if this is green the cell is selected);\n",
    "-  Go to the *Main Menu* bar, click on *Cell --> Run Cells*. Alternatively, you can use a keyboard shortcut (e.g., <code>**Ctrl + Enter**</code>).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I **strongly** recommend you not to delete nor modify this notebook in any of its parts. As this is not a read-only file, anyone could make changes to it. Should you do it by mistake, just download this notebook file again from our [Moodle web page](https://elearning.unipd.it/math/course/view.php?id=321)."

If <code>**X**</code> is already $2$-by-$2$ then it is **also** the core matrix. If, instead, <code>**X**</code> is $4$-by-$4$ then the core matrix will be the $2$-by-$2$ sub-matrix identified by the elements of the second and third rows (i.e., row at index = 1 and row at index = 2) and second and third columns (i.e., column at index = 1, column at index = 2). More generally, if the dimension of the input matrix is $n$, the starting index of the row (column) of the core matrix can be found by computing $(n-2)/2$. For $n = 2$, this turns out to be 0, which is exactly what we expected, for $n = 4$, this is going to be 1 which, again, is what we found above, for $n = 6$, the starting index is 2, and so on and so forth (see the picture below).<br />\n",
